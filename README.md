# Sets

In this project, I explore the use of Sets ordered and unordered to act as storage containers with iterators and lists.

The files included are the implementations of the whole project.

## Key Feautures

- Programmed in Java
- Used Abstract Set Data Type/Storage Container
- Used Iteration Implementations
- Used ArrayList Implementations

## Data Structure Class

This course deepened my knowledge of software design through the lenses of an object-oriented perspective. I learned to implemented commmon data structures to organize and manipulate data such as linked lists, recursion, binary trees, and hash tables to list a few. I was made aware of the tradeoffs software developers have to deal with when designing projects and how to handle them. The class also allowed students to explore algorithms and structures in standard code.
